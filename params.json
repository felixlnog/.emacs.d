{"name":"emacs配置文件","tagline":"","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/purcell/emacs.d.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/purcell/emacs.d)\r\n\r\n# A reasonable Emacs config\r\n\r\nThis is my emacs configuration tree, continually used and tweaked\r\nsince 2000, and it may be a good starting point for other Emacs\r\nusers, especially those who are web developers. These days it's\r\nsomewhat geared towards OS X, but it is known to also work on Linux\r\nand Windows.\r\n\r\nEmacs itself comes with support for many programming languages. This\r\nconfig adds improved defaults and extended support for the following:\r\n\r\n* Ruby / Ruby on Rails\r\n* CSS / LESS / SASS / SCSS\r\n* HAML / Markdown / Textile / ERB\r\n* Clojure (with Cider and nRepl)\r\n* Javascript / Coffeescript\r\n* Python\r\n* PHP\r\n* Haskell\r\n* Erlang\r\n* Common Lisp (with Slime)\r\n\r\nIn particular, there's a nice config for *tab autocompletion*, and\r\nflycheck is used to immediately highlight syntax errors in Ruby, HAML,\r\nPython, Javascript, PHP and a number of other languages.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Emacs 23.3 or greater (note that Emacs 24 is required for some\r\n  functionality, including `magit` and `flycheck`, and will likely\r\n  become the minimum required version some time soon.)\r\n* To make the most of the programming language-specific support in\r\n  this config, further programs will likely be required, particularly\r\n  those that [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) uses to\r\n  provide on-the-fly syntax checking.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the\r\n`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party\r\npackages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you\r\nencounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly\r\nrunning `M-x package-refresh-contents` before doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important note about `ido`\r\n\r\nThis config enables `ido-mode` completion in the minibuffer wherever\r\npossible, which might confuse you when trying to open files using\r\n<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, e.g. when you want to open a directory to use\r\n`dired` -- if you get stuck, use <kbd>C-f</kbd> to drop into the\r\nregular `find-file` prompt. (You might want to customize the\r\n`ido-show-dot-for-dired` variable if this is an issue for you.)\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\nUpdate the config with `git pull`. You'll probably also want/need to update\r\nthe third-party packages regularly too:\r\n\r\n<kbd>M-x package-list-packages</kbd>, then <kbd>U</kbd> followed by <kbd>x</kbd>.\r\n\r\n## Adding your own customization\r\n\r\nTo add your own customization, use <kbd>M-x customize</kbd> and/or\r\ncreate a file `~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el` which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```el\r\n... your code here ...\r\n\r\n(provide 'init-local)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need initialisation code which executes earlier in the startup process,\r\nyou can also create an `~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-preload-local.el` file.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to customize things more extensively, you should probably\r\njust fork the repo and hack away at the config to make it your own!\r\n\r\n## Similar configs\r\n\r\nYou might also want to check out `emacs-starter-kit` and `prelude`.\r\n\r\n## Support / issues\r\n\r\nIf you hit any problems, please first ensure that you are using the latest version\r\nof this code, and that you have updated your packages to the most recent available\r\nversions (see \"Updates\" above). If you still experience problems, go ahead and\r\n[file an issue on the github project](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d).\r\n\r\n-Steve Purcell\r\n","google":"UA-65602364-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
